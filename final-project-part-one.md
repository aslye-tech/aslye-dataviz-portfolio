# Outline 
 
Baltimore is known for it's fantastic history, great food, and rich sports culture. However, Baltimore Public Schools have not been so nice in recent years. 
In a study conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2022, only 7% of Baltimore City Public School students performed at or above the 
NAEP proficient level (reference 3 down below). In my presentation, I want to give my audience a look into what the current state of the Baltimore City 
Public School system looks like and ways we can address this. 

My audience of this case would be to Baltimore schoolboard members that can actively make a difference in this case. To effectively convey my story, I want 
to break this down into 3 key areas: the setup, the conflict, and the resolution. In the setup, I want to show some bad things that Baltimore is known for 
and how they have improved in the past year or so. For example, Crime has always been an issue in Baltimore for a long time, so seeing a 22% drop in homicides 
for Baltimore is a big deal! In the conflict, I want to highlight the bad stuff around Baltimore Public Schools. I want to highlight data that shows the 
horrific math and reading proficiency rates in Baltimore by citing bi-annual Nations Report Card report on Baltimore Public Schools. Finally, I want to give 
the audience some sort of way to attack this. I will propose some bills that are currently in circulation around Baltimore Public Schools that can directly 
impact learning for Baltimore Public School students such as improvements to building facilities and an investment in more opportunities to learn and grow 
throug directed tutoring and programs geared towards literacy and math scores.

# The data

I am using 2 key data sets for this story: The NAEP Nations Report Card and Crime Stats from the Baltimore Police Department (links in table down below). The NAEP Nations Report Card, highlights some key statistics regarding academic performance across school systems across the US. This report usually happens every 2 years and highlights scores such as average reading, math, science, and writing. For my case, I will be looking at the national average in math and reading in the US, and compare it to the average scores in Baltimore City. The grades that are looked into for these scores are 4th grade and 8th grade. For the sake of this story, I will focus on the 4th grade reports.
The Baltimore Police Department releases statistics on all things crime related in the city of Baltimore. They often use very cool designs using ArcGIS to display the type of crime, when, and where. I will use this to specifically look at homicide rates in Baltimore, Maryland. I want to utilize this report in the setup phase of my story to give the audience some sort of positive hope. For a very long time, Baltimore has been known as a place with very bad crime or homice rates and in recent years these numbers have dropped in a good way. I want to show the reader that the city can improve and change for the better!

|   NAEP Nations Report Card   |  https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/snapshots/   |        Since 1969, the NAEP has collected data on how school are doing throughout the US through tests and surveys. The report they post is a check-up on how each city is doing in core learning areas such as math, reading, science, and writing. This data set is crucial for my project, as it gives access to proficiency scores and average test scores that I will use in the conflict phase of my story.      |
|   Crime Stats - Baltimore Police Department   |   https://www.baltimorepolice.org/crime-stats  |      The Baltimore Police Department keeps track of crimes across the city of Baltimore. I will use this data specifically in the setup phase of my story to highlight some growth that Baltimore has had in recent years with their historic struggles.        |

# Method and medium

To make my designs, I will be utilizing tableau for both of these designs. I have used excel in the past, but through my experiences in Telling Stories with Data, I love the functionalities that tableau has to offer regarding color schemes, grouping, and overall ease of use. Once the designs are made, I will then move over to storyboard to line out my information. All of the data visualizations in storyboard will be paired with some words on the side to callout any major points on the data visualization, or will utilize the scroll-like feature to show the change in time between certain statistics.
