> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
Baltimore is known for it's fantastic history, great food, and rich sports culture. However, Baltimore Public Schools have not been so nice in recent years. 
In a study conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2022, only 7% of Baltimore City Public School students performed at or above the 
NAEP proficient level. In my presentation, I want to give my audience a look into what the current state of the Baltimore City Public School system looks 
like and ways we can address this. 

My audience of this case would be to Baltimore schoolboard members that can actively make a difference in this case. To effectively convey my story, I want 
to break this down into 3 key areas: the setup, the conflict, and the resolution. In the setup, I want to show some bad things that Baltimore is known for 
and how they have improved in the past year or so. For example, Crime has always been an issue in Baltimore for a long time, so seeing a 22% drop in homicides 
for Baltimore is a big deal! In the conflict, I want to highlight the bad stuff around Baltimore Public Schools. I want to highlight data that shows the 
horrific math and reading proficiency rates in Baltimore by citing bi-annual Nations Report Card report on Baltimore Public Schools. Finally, I want to give 
the audience some sort of way to attack this. I will propose some bills that are currently in circulation around Baltimore Public Schools that can directly 
impact learning for Baltimore Public School students such as improvements to building facilities and an investment in more opportunities to learn and grow 
throug directed tutoring and programs geared towards literacy and math scores.

|   NAEP Nations Report Card   |  https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/snapshots/   |        Since 1969, the NAEP has collected data on how school are doing throughout the US through tests and surveys. The report they post is a check-up on how each city is doing in core learning areas such as math, reading, science, and writing. This data set is crucial for my project, as it gives access to proficiency scores and average test scores that I will use in the conflict phase of my story.      |
|   Crime Stats - Baltimore Police Department   |   https://www.baltimorepolice.org/crime-stats  |      The Baltimore Police Department keeps track of crimes across the city of Baltimore. I will use this data specifically in the setup phase of my story to highlight some growth that Baltimore has had in recent years with their historic struggles.        |
