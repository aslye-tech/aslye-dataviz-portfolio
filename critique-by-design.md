# My Cool Data Viz Recreation!

## Step one: the visualization

Original Vizualization: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-2025s-best-countries-to-live-and-work/#google_vignette 

I like to travel and explore other countries and their respective cultures, so when I found this data visualization on Makeover Monday (link here: https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) I was immediately interested. When I was reading the data visualization, I caught myself wandering around the page and could not really focus on the key parts of the display. There was an area highlighted with the column title of "Total Score" that caught my attention, but outside of that it seemed like there was a bit too much going on. Because of this, I decided to take the challenge of simplifying this data visualization for other readers that might be interested in this analysis. 

## Step two: the critique

Initial Thoughts on the Viz:

The first thing that stood out to me was the variety of colors and highlighted "Total Score" column. What I thought worked well in the visualization was how they sorted the countries from highest to lowest total score, which makes logical sense and directs the reader to the best score immediately. I also love how they highlighted the "Total Score" column, since that is the data point that stands out the most. 

I thought the color scheme did not work out well. I do like the fact that the variety of colors is not much, but the usage of yellow for the highest numbers and green/blue for the lower numbers does not make much sense to me. I would have liked to see this color scheme flipped, where green was for the higher colors, blue for the mid-to-high colors, and yellow for the lower numbers. Could also do different shades of one color, (i.e. different shades of green). I also thought that the use of specific digits to grade the countries makes it a bit hard for the reader to read and analyze the information. Maybe replacing the numbers with letter grades might help with this? 

Primary Audience: 

The primary audience for this tool would be for travelers or immigrants that are looking to move to another country to live. I believe the visualization can help someone like that, as it does highlight some important ratings that a traveler might want to know when deciding to live in another country. It can serve as a good starting point for someone, and can potentially lead the reader to analyze the data further by researching types of jobs or livability ratings. I think this visualization does a good job of reaching that audience. 

What I Will Try to Focus on: 

I would like to focus on the color scheme, the amount of numbers, and really just focus on simplifying the visualization to make it easier for the reader to understand. I want to flirt with the type of color pattern specifically by starting with a traditional "sequential" color pattern of green, where darker green indicates a higher value and lighter green indicates a lower value. I am also very excited to correlate the numbers here with a specific letter grade, that way the reader can scan through the list quicker while maintaining the impact of values. Finally, I would like to take away some of the country flags from the list to limit eye movement in the visualization. Major goal: make the reader's life easier by simplifying the visualization while keeping a strong, impactful message. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1758239085307' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Top 10 Countries to Live and Work in 2025Based on average score across 6 categories: Career Advancement, Earning Potential, Economic Mobility, High Livibility, and Premium Education ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ma&#47;MakeoverMonday-AssignmentWeek3&#47;MondayMakeoverDraft&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='MakeoverMonday-AssignmentWeek3&#47;MondayMakeoverDraft' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ma&#47;MakeoverMonday-AssignmentWeek3&#47;MondayMakeoverDraft&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1758239085307');
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

## Step four: Test the solution

Questions I asked: 

1) Before you I tell you any background information, what do you think this visualization is showing? 

2) What does my visualization tell you about the topic? 

3) Is there anything about my visualization that you think is confusing or hard to understand? 

4) How would you improve this visualization?

Some general notes about my interviewees:

Participant 2: In-class interview - Heinz Student

Results: 

Some general notes 

| Question | In-Class Participant 1 | In-Class Participant 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|     1     |       Top countries to live and work at in 2025      |    Top countries to live and work at in 2025         |
|     2     |       Switzerland is top of the list      |       Switzerland is #1      |
|     3     |       What does "Score" mean and how is that calculated?      |       How are the scores determined?       |
|     4     |       I would title the "Score" axis to be a bit more specific. Maybe "average score" would work better.      |      I would get rid of some white space by making the image a bit larger      |

Synthesis: 

I learned that the title and color scheme made it easy for my readers to quickly diagnose what the topic is and who is ranked where. However, I discovered that the axis titles I chose can be a bit misleading, as they are too generic. For every interview, I got the same question of "what does the score mean?" Because of this, I need to better label the axis to make it clearer to the audience. Also, I noted that the article included multiple columns to my interviewers. This led to the idea of providing some sort of slicer for the reader, that way it boost interactivity and gives the reader a clearer picture into how the scores are determined. Overall, good reviews but definitely some areas to work on.

## Step five: build the solution

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1758242120260' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Top 10 Countries to Live and Work in 2025Note: &quot;Score&quot; is based on the average score across 6 categories: Career Advancement, Earning Potential, Economic Mobility, Employment Prospects, High Livibility, and Premium Education. Use the slicer to scroll thr ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ma&#47;MakeoverMonday-AssignmentWeek3&#47;MondayMakeoverFinal&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='MakeoverMonday-AssignmentWeek3&#47;MondayMakeoverFinal' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ma&#47;MakeoverMonday-AssignmentWeek3&#47;MondayMakeoverFinal&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1758242120260');
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

When I first made my analysis of the visualization, I wanted to play with the idea of using some sort of letter grade for these numbers. However, I felt that this would have made the data misleading because seeing a score of "C" making it in the top 10 scores make the reader seem like traveling or moving to another country is an awful idea. I also love the advice that one of my interviewees made which was to add a slicer into this visualization. This made the visualization clear, allows the reader to interact with the data, all while providing the reader with all the necessary information in a clear and effective manner. I wanted to give some sort of color scheme here that shows the connection between each region. I was also considering making the shades of blue vary with each individual slicer, but I thought it would be nice to keep a consistent color so when the reader does scroll into different categories, they can still associate the darker shades with higher average overall scores. If I were to do any extra interviews, I would probably ask a question about this to see if readers like it or not. Overall, very fun to work on this!
