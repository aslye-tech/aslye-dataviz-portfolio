# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My target audience are administrators and other members of the Baltimore Public Education System.  I want to target this audience specifically becuase they are in a place to actually make a difference on this approach. Originally, I was debating discussing this to local parents. However, I opted not to do this, as I figured presenting this to administrators that are directly involved in Baltimore Public Education might change some things up. I got 2 of my interviews from class, but I wanted to get one from someone that understands the situation in Baltimore a bit more. Therefore, I decided to interview my father, who has grown up around the Baltimore area and has coached many kids in football from Baltimore. His experience with some of the kids is very valuable and would help me a lot in creating a better narrative for the audience. My hope is to inspire some sort of change in Baltimore Public Schools regarding our approach to students. Really investing into not just them as students, but to them as people will spark a lot of positive growth among students.

## Interview script

The biggest goal I want to conduct from my research is the overall flow and understanding of my story. I want to take the target audience through a journey that makes logical sense and makes the audience want to act quickly on the education system in Baltimore. Essentially, inspire change among administrators in Baltimore. As a result, my questions are based on ensuring the story flow itself makes sense.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   To ensure nothing seems random or makes no logical sense in terms of ordering   |         Does the overall flow of the story make sense?         |
|   To ensure clarity in the overall message   |         Was there anything that was confusing or hard to understand?         |
|   To make sure my message is clear and address any holes in the story    |         Is there a big hole in the story that you would like to see included in the story?         |


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

I gathered some great insight regarding story flow from my interviews, including things that I did not think about addressing! What I loved was that the responses were geared towards creating a bit more power in the overall message of the story. I discovered that there is a bit more to the story than simply throwing more money into  schools and hoping they get better. Going into detail about how these kids can improve and understanding more of their personal background is very crucial to the success of a student. Below are findings from my interviews...

| Questions               | In-Class Interview | In-Class Interview | Maryland Native/Father |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does the overall flow of the story make sense? | I like the overall flow of the story!            |     I thougt the story made a lot of sense!        |       I like the overall flow, but I would probably go a bit more into what the plan of action is for the audience      |
|             Was there anything that was confusing or hard to understand?            |                Not really, but I thought the crime data was a bit interesting. It might take some attention away from the schools               |      I would like to have seen a bit more detail on what the average scores are and what they mean        |       There was a plan of action, but I would love to see you go more into this. Explain where money should be spent specifically     |
|           Is there a big hole in the story that you help with the story?               |                I think there is a bit of a hole in the final plan of action. Would like to see if increasing money invested in school system actually helps.                |      I would go into the plan of action with a bit more detail. Can do a national comparison between Baltimore investments and other cities       |      Really just the plan of action. Some more data on this like why spending more money would be helpful. Also, keep in mind that many inner city kids that go to public schools do not grow up in the best environment. Try to go more into how a teacher or someone personally investing into a kid can impact a kid's life.      |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Go more into detail with the Plan of Action | I kind of touched the surface a bit with my plan of action, but I definitely need to go further. I will look more into total educational investment into each city, then compare them with Baltimore and see the difference in scores.  |
|                   Crime data might be a bit too much                       |           I can totally see how the crime data can take away the spotlight from the education side. My original goal was to show that Baltimore can improve on things, and crime has been a recent example of this. However, I was showing it a bit too much. I will minimize the crime data to just one snip so I can show Baltimore representatives that change can be done.                                                                      |
|                   Provide a bit more clarity on what the score results are and what they mean                       |                         I kinda just threw numbers on a screen and did not define them the best. I believe giving a better background on how the scoring system works and where the information is coming from will be very beneficial for the reader. The Maryland education representatives probably know this stuff already, but just in case it might be best to give a quick general overview of the nations report card study.                                                        |
|                     Address some situations that a Baltimore kid might go through.                     |                    This is a fantastic point! I've had many friends from Baltimore that grew up in some very rough living conditions. Some feel that school is a complete waste of time and that taking care of their family might be more important. Sadly in some circumstances, some kids might feel pressure from neighbors or friends that are apart of gangs and feel that the gang life is more important than the school. In short, some kids feel like they are stuck in their environment, which certainly impacts both personal growth. I will make sure to touch on this more in my story.                                                            |


In conclusion, I definitely have some more work to do! Bringing in more data to the story will be critical to paint a better picture. Therefore, I will make sure I invest a bit more time into
